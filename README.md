# 3D Renderer with Raytracing Features
A homemade 3D renderer using VEX language in Houdini, with raytracing features like global illumination and reflections.

Houdini is a software used in Visual Effects industry, and also a great tool for technical artists to use in game industry, such as procedural modeling and multi-tasking. 

This project is to demonstrate my ability of linear algebra use, as well as physical-based rendering & light calculating.
